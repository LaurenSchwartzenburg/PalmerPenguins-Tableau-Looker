# Tableau Dashboard Findings

Tableau was used to develop the primary Palmer Penguins dashboard, allowing for a multi-layered visual storytelling experience with refined layout control and interactive features.

## Benefits

* **Multi-visual support** — Tableau makes it easy to stack or juxtapose multiple chart types on a single dashboard, creating detailed yet intuitive layouts.
* **Refined layout control** — You have strong control over spacing, padding, alignment, and the visual flow of each section. This helps ensure the dashboard feels well-organized and readable.
* **Flexible interactivity** — Dropdowns, filters, and parameter options are extensive. You can customize user interactions to highlight patterns across different variables with precision.
* **Inspiration-rich** — Tableau Public offers a vast community of dashboards to draw ideas from, both in design and function.
* **Actively updated** — Tableau regularly releases updates, and it’s clear the platform is continually evolving. It feels like a long-term, improving product.

## Challenges

* **File path rigidity** — Tableau can break links to data sources if files are moved, due to its reliance on static file paths. This can be frustrating when reorganizing folders or collaborating across systems. Their cloud publishing feature saves the day though. 
* **Glitch-related data loss** — During this project, I experienced several glitches that resulted in lost work. Saving frequently and using versioning is essential.
* **Learning curve for deeper features** — While it’s intuitive at a basic level, advanced interactivity and formatting require additional learning or tutorials.

## Conclusion

Tableau is a powerful platform for building rich, interactive dashboards with clean user flow and a polished aesthetic. It’s ideal for use cases that benefit from **layered visuals, interactivity, and precise formatting** — especially when data volume is moderate and the user experience matters.

Despite occasional bugs, Tableau remains one of the most flexible and forward-moving dashboard tools.
